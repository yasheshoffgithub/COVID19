# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

## Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL for data extraction and transformation, followed by visualization using Tableau. The objective is to gain insights into the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 across different regions and timeframes.

## 🛠️ SQL Data Exploration
- **🔍 Data Extraction:** The project begins by extracting COVID-19 data from multiple publicly available datasets. SQL is used to perform complex queries to aggregate and analyze key metrics, such as infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates.
  
- **🧹 Data Transformation:** Data cleaning and normalization techniques are applied to ensure data integrity and improve query performance. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing data formats.

- **📊 Key Queries:** The SQL queries focus on identifying trends, comparing metrics across different regions, and calculating time-series data to observe how the situation evolves over time.

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
- **💻 Interactive Visualization:** The processed data is then visualized using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. This dashboard allows users to explore COVID-19 trends, including daily new cases, recovery rates, and vaccination progress across various regions.

- **📈 Dashboard Features:** The Tableau dashboard includes custom visualizations such as heatmaps, line charts, and bar graphs, which provide a clear and concise view of the pandemic's impact. The dashboard also includes filters and interactive elements to enable users to drill down into specific data points.

- **🔗 Access the Dashboard:** You can view the Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yashesh.pratap.singh/viz/COVID19DASHBOARD_17239909241810/Dashboard1).

## 📝 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualization. The combination of these tools provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, offering valuable insights that can support decision-making and further research.
